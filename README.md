# graph-isomorphism-deep-learning

This is a class project to detect isomorphism between graphs. Graph isomorphism is a class NP problem which is hard and requires a lot of computation for big sized graphs. Is it possible to find a neural network that can detect isomorphism between graphs. This is a hubmle attempt to detect isomorphism between graphs of same number of nodes N, and different number of edges.
